/**
 * TimelineLite is a powerful sequencing tool that acts as a container for tweens and 
 * other timelines, making it simple to control them as a whole and precisely manage their
 * timing in relation to each other. Without TimelineLite (or its big brother TimelineMax), building 
 * complex sequences would be far more cumbersome because you'd need to use the <code>delay</code> special property
 * for everything which would make future edits far more tedious. Here is a basic example of a 
 * sequence <strong>without</strong> using TimelineLite (the tedious way): 
 * <listing version="3.0">
TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:100});
TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {y:50, delay:1});
TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {alpha:0, delay:2});
</listing>
 * The above code animates <code>mc.x</code> to 100, then <code>mc.y</code> to 50, and finally 
 * <code>mc.alpha</code> to 0 (notice the <code>delay</code> in all but the first tween). But 
 * imagine if you wanted to increase the duration of the first tween to 1.5 - you'd need to
 * adjust every delay thereafter. And what if you want to <code>pause()</code> the whole 
 * sequence or <code>restart()</code> it or <code>reverse()</code> it on-the-fly or jump to
 * a specific point in the whole animation? This becomes quite messy (or flat-out impossible), 
 * but TimelineLite makes it incredibly simple:
 * 
 * <listing version="3.0">
var tl = new TimelineLite();
tl.add( TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:100}) );
tl.add( TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {y:50}) );
tl.add( TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {alpha:0}) );
 
//then later, control the whole thing...
tl.pause();
tl.resume();
tl.seek(1.5);
tl.reverse();
...
</listing>
 * Or use the convenient <code>to()</code> method and chaining to make it even more concise:
 * <listing version="3.0">
var tl = new TimelineLite();
tl.to(mc, 1, {x:100}).to(mc, 1, {y:50}).to(mc, 1, {alpha:0});
</listing>
 * 
 * <p>Now you can adjust any of the tweens without worrying about trickle-down
 * changes to delays. Increase the duration of that first tween and everything automatically
 * adjusts!</p>
 * 
 * <p>Here are some other benefits and features of TimelineLite:</p>
 * 
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> Things can overlap on the timeline as much as you want. You have complete control 
 * 			over where tweens/timelines are placed. Most other animation tools can only do basic 
 * 			one-after-the-other sequencing but can't allow things to overlap. Imagine appending
 * 			a tween that moves an object and you want it to start fading out 0.5 seconds before the 
 * 			end of that tween? With TimelineLite it's easy.</li>
 * 
 * 		<li> Add labels, play(), stop(), seek(), restart(), and even reverse() smoothly anytime.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> Nest timelines within timelines as deeply as you want. This means you can modularize
 * 			your code and make it far more efficient. Imagine building your app with common animateIn() 
 * 			and animateOut() methods that return a tween or timeline instance, then you can string 
 * 			things together like 
 * 			<code>myTimeline.add( myObject.animateIn() ).add( myObject.animateOut(), "+=4").add( myObject2.animateIn(), "-=0.5")...</code></li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> Speed up or slow down the entire timeline with its <code>timeScale()</code> method. 
 * 			You can even tween it to gradually speed up or slow down the animation smoothly.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> Get or set the progress of the timeline using its <code>progress()</code> method. 
 * 			For example, to skip to the halfway point, set <code>myTimeline.progress(0.5);</code></li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> Tween the <code>time</code> or <code>progress</code> to fastforward/rewind 
 * 			the timeline. You could even attach a slider to one of these properties to give the 
 * 			user the ability to drag forward/backward through the timeline.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> Add <code>onComplete, onStart, onUpdate,</code> and/or <code>onReverseComplete</code> 
 * 			callbacks using the constructor's <code>vars</code> object like
 * 			<code>var tl = new TimelineLite({onComplete:myFunction});</code></li>
 * 
 * 		<li> Kill the tweens of a particular object inside the timeline with <code>kill(null, target)</code> 
 * 			or get the tweens of an object with <code>getTweensOf()</code> or get all the tweens/timelines 
 * 			in the timeline with <code>getChildren()</code></li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> By passing <code>useFrames:true</code> in the <code>vars</code> parameter, you can
 * 			base the timing on frames instead of seconds. Please note, however, that
 * 		  the timeline's timing mode dictates its childrens' timing mode as well. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> You can export all the tween/timelines from the root (master) timeline anytime into 
 * 			a TimelineLite instance using <code>TimelineLite.exportRoot()</code> so that
 * 			you can <code>pause()</code> them all or <code>reverse()</code> or alter their 
 * 			<code>timeScale</code>, etc. without affecting tweens/timelines that you create in
 * 			the future. Imagine a game that has all its animation driven by the GreenSock 
 * 			Animation Platform and it needs to pause or slow down while a status screen pops up. 
 * 			Very easy.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> If you need even more features like <code>repeat, repeatDelay, yoyo, currentLabel(), 
 * 			getLabelAfter(), getLabelBefore(), addCallback(), removeCallback(), getActive()</code>, 
 * 			AS3 event listeners and more, check out TimelineMax which extends TimelineLite.</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * 
 * <p><strong>SPECIAL PROPERTIES:</strong></p>
 * <p>You can optionally use the constructor's <code>vars</code> parameter to define any of
 * the special properties below (syntax example: <code>new TimelineLite({onComplete:myFunction, delay:2});</code></p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><strong> delay </strong>:<em> Number</em> -
 * 				 Amount of delay in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens) before the timeline should begin.</li>
 * 
 *  <li><strong> paused </strong>:<em> Boolean</em> -
 * 				 If <code>true</code>, the timeline will pause itself immediately upon creation (by default, 
 * 				 timelines automatically begin playing immediately). If you plan to create a TimelineLite and 
 * 				 then populate it later (after one or more frames elapse), it is typically best to set 
 * 				 <code>paused:true</code> and then <code>play()</code> after you populate it.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onComplete </strong>:<em> Function</em> -
 * 				 A function that should be called when the timeline has completed</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onCompleteParams </strong>:<em> Array</em> -
 * 				 An Array of parameters to pass the <code>onComplete</code> function. For example,
 * 				 <code>new TimelineLite({onComplete:myFunction, onCompleteParams:["param1", "param2"]});</code>
 * 				 To self-reference the timeline instance itself in one of the parameters, use <code>"{self}"</code>,
 * 				 like: <code>onCompleteParams:["{self}", "param2"]</code></li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> useFrames </strong>:<em> Boolean</em> -
 * 				 If <code>useFrames</code> is <code>true</code>, the timelines's timing will be 
 * 				 based on frames instead of seconds because it is intially added to the root
 * 				 frames-based timeline. This causes both its <code>duration</code>
 * 				 and <code>delay</code> to be based on frames. An animations's timing mode is 
 * 				 always determined by its parent <code>timeline</code>.</li>
 * 
 *  <li><strong> tweens </strong>:<em> Array</em> -
 * 				 To immediately insert several tweens into the timeline, use the <code>tweens</code> 
 * 				 special property to pass in an Array of TweenLite/TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax 
 * 				 instances. You can use this in conjunction with the <code>align</code> and 
 * 				 <code>stagger</code> special properties to set up complex sequences with minimal code.
 * 				 These values simply get passed to the <code>add()</code> method.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> align </strong>:<em> String</em> -
 * 				 Only used in conjunction with the <code>tweens</code> special property when multiple 
 * 				 tweens are	to be inserted immediately. The value simply gets passed to the 
 * 				 <code>add()</code> method. The default is <code>"normal"</code>. 
 * 				 Options are:
 * 					<ul>
 * 						<li><strong><code>"sequence"</code></strong>: aligns the tweens one-after-the-other in a sequence</li>
 * 						<li><strong><code>"start"</code></strong>: aligns the start times of all of the tweens (ignores delays)</li>
 * 						<li><strong><code>"normal"</code></strong>: aligns the start times of all the tweens (honors delays)</li>
 * 					</ul>
 * 				The <code>align</code> special property does <strong>not</strong> force all child 
 * 				tweens/timelines to maintain relative positioning, so for example, if you use 
 * 				<code>"sequence"</code> and then later change the duration of one of the nested tweens, 
 * 				it does <strong>not</strong> force all subsequent timelines to change their position.
 * 				The <code>align</code> special property only affects the alignment of the tweens that are
 * 				initially placed into the timeline through the <code>tweens</code> special property of 
 * 				the <code>vars</code> object.</li>
 * 										
 * 	<li><strong> stagger </strong>:<em> Number</em> -
 * 				 Only used in conjunction with the <code>tweens</code> special property when multiple 
 * 				 tweens are	to be added immediately. It staggers the tweens by a set amount of time 
 * 				 in seconds (or in frames if <code>useFrames</code> is true). For example, if the 
 * 				 stagger value is 0.5 and the "align" property is set to <code>"start"</code>, the 
 * 				 second tween will start 0.5 seconds after the first one starts, then 0.5 seconds 
 * 				 later the third one will start, etc. If the align property is <code>"sequence"</code>,
 * 				 there would be 0.5 seconds added between each tween. This value simply gets 
 * 				 passed to the <code>add()</code> method. Default is 0.</li>
 * 
 *  <li><strong> onStart </strong>:<em> Function</em> -
 * 				 A function that should be called when the timeline begins (when its <code>time</code>
 * 				 changes from 0 to some other value which can happen more than once if the 
 * 				 timeline is restarted multiple times).</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onStartParams </strong>:<em> Array</em> -
 * 				 An Array of parameters to pass the <code>onStart</code> function. For example, 
 * 				 <code>new TimelineLite({onStart:myFunction, onStartParams:["param1", "param2"]});</code>
 * 				 To self-reference the timeline instance itself in one of the parameters, use <code>"{self}"</code>,
 * 				 like: <code>onStartParams:["{self}", "param2"]</code></li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onUpdate </strong>:<em> Function</em> -
 * 				 A function that should be called every time the timeline updates  
 * 				 (on every frame while the timeline is active)</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onUpdateParams </strong>:<em> Array</em> -
 * 				 An Array of parameters to pass the <code>onUpdate</code> function. For example,
 * 				 <code>new TimelineLite({onUpdate:myFunction, onUpdateParams:["param1", "param2"]});</code>
 * 				 To self-reference the timeline instance itself in one of the parameters, use <code>"{self}"</code>,
 * 				 like: <code>onUpdateParams:["{self}", "param2"]</code></li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onReverseComplete </strong>:<em> Function</em> -
 * 				 A function that should be called when the timeline has reached its beginning again from the 
 * 				 reverse direction. For example, if <code>reverse()</code> is called, the timeline will move
 * 				 back towards its beginning and when its <code>time</code> reaches 0, <code>onReverseComplete</code>
 * 				 will be called. This can also happen if the timeline is placed in a TimelineLite or TimelineMax 
 * 				 instance that gets reversed and plays the timeline backwards to (or past) the beginning.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><strong> onReverseCompleteParams </strong>:<em> Array</em> -
 * 				 An Array of parameters to pass the <code>onReverseComplete</code> function. For example, 
 * 				 <code>new TimelineLite({onReverseComplete:myFunction, onReverseCompleteParams:["param1", "param2"]});</code>
 * 				 To self-reference the timeline instance itself in one of the parameters, use <code>"{self}"</code>,
 * 				 like: <code>onReverseCompleteParams:["{self}", "param2"]</code></li>
 * 
 * <li><strong> autoRemoveChildren </strong>:<em> Boolean</em> -
 * 				If <code>autoRemoveChildren</code> is set to <code>true</code>, as soon as child 
 * 				tweens/timelines complete, they will automatically get killed/removed. This is normally 
 * 				undesireable because it prevents going backwards in time (like if you want to 
 * 				<code>reverse()</code> or set the <code>progress</code> lower, etc.). It can, however, 
 * 				improve speed and memory management. The root timelines use <code>autoRemoveChildren:true</code>.</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong> smoothChildTiming </strong>:<em> Boolean</em> -
 * 				Controls whether or not child tweens/timelines are repositioned automatically 
 * 				(changing their <code>startTime</code>) in order to maintain smooth playback when 
 * 				properties are changed on-the-fly. For example, imagine that the timeline's playhead is 
 * 				on a child tween that is 75% complete, moving mc.x from 0 to 100 and then that tween's 
 * 				<code>reverse()</code> method is called. If <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>false</code> 
 * 				(the default except for the root timelines), the tween would flip in place, keeping its 
 * 				<code>startTime</code> consistent. Therefore the playhead of the timeline would now be 
 * 				at the tween's 25% completion point instead of 75%. Remember, the timeline's playhead 
 * 				position and direction are unaffected by child tween/timeline changes. mc.x would jump 
 * 				from 75 to 25, but the tween's position in the timeline would remain consistent. However, 
 * 				if <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>true</code>, that child tween's 
 * 				<code>startTime</code> would be adjusted so that the timeline's playhead intersects 
 * 				with the same spot on the tween (75% complete) as it had immediately before 
 * 				<code>reverse()</code> was called, thus playback appears perfectly smooth. mc.x 
 * 				would still be 75 and it would continue from there as the playhead moves on, but 
 * 				since the tween is reversed now mc.x will travel back towards 0 instead of 100. 
 * 				Ultimately it's a decision between prioritizing smooth on-the-fly playback 
 * 				(<code>true</code>) or consistent position(s) of child tweens/timelines 
 * 				(<code>false</code>). 
 * 
 * 				Some examples of on-the-fly changes to child tweens/timelines that could cause their 
 * 				<code>startTime</code> to change when <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>true</code> 
 * 				are: <code>reversed, timeScale, progress, totalProgress, time, totalTime, delay, pause, 
 * 				resume, duration,</code> and <code>totalDuration</code>.</li>
 * 	
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * @example Sample code:<listing version="3.0">
//create the timeline with an onComplete callback that calls myFunction() when the timeline completes
var tl = new TimelineLite({onComplete:myFunction});

//add a tween
tl.add( new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:200, y:100}) );
		
//add another tween at the end of the timeline (makes sequencing easy)
tl.add( new TweenLite(mc, 0.5, {alpha:0}) );
 
//append a tween using the convenience method (shorter syntax) and offset it by 0.5 seconds
tl.to(mc, 1, {rotation:30}, "+=0.5");
 		
//reverse anytime
tl.reverse();

//Add a "spin" label 3-seconds into the timeline
tl.add("spin", 3);

//insert a rotation tween at the "spin" label (you could also define the insertion point as the time instead of a label)
tl.add( new TweenLite(mc, 2, {rotation:"360"}), "spin");
	
//go to the "spin" label and play the timeline from there
tl.play("spin");

//nest another TimelineLite inside your timeline...
var nested = new TimelineLite();
nested.to(mc2, 1, {x:200}));
tl.add(nested);

		 * so if you <code>exportRoot()</code> again, that TimelineLite would get wrapped into another one,
		 * etc. Things can be nested as deeply as you want.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>Keep in mind, however, that completed tweens/timelines are removed from the root (for automatic 
		 * garbage collection), so if you <code>exportRoot()</code> after a tween completes, it won't be
