/**
 * Loads an FLV, F4V, or MP4 video file using a NetStream and also provides convenient playback methods 
 * and properties like <code>pauseVideo(), playVideo(), gotoVideoTime(), bufferProgress, playProgress, volume, 
 * duration, videoPaused, metaData, </code> and <code>videoTime</code>. Just like ImageLoader and SWFLoader, 
 * VideoLoader's <code>content</code> property refers to a <code>ContentDisplay</code> object (Sprite) that 
 * gets created immediately so that you can position/scale/rotate it or add ROLL_OVER/ROLL_OUT/CLICK listeners
 * before (or while) the video loads. Use the VideoLoader's <code>content</code> property to get the ContentDisplay 
 * Sprite, or use the <code>rawContent</code> property to get the <code>Video</code> object that is used inside the 
 * ContentDisplay to display the video. If a <code>container</code> is defined in the <code>vars</code> object, 
 * the ContentDisplay will immediately be added to that container).
 * 
 * <p>You don't need to worry about creating a NetConnection, a Video object, attaching the NetStream, or any 
 * of the typical hassles. VideoLoader can even scale the video into the area you specify using scaleModes 
 * like <code>"stretch", "proportionalInside", "proportionalOutside",</code> and more. A VideoLoader will 
 * dispatch useful events like <code>VIDEO_COMPLETE, VIDEO_PAUSE, VIDEO_PLAY, VIDEO_BUFFER_FULL, 
 * VIDEO_BUFFER_EMPTY, NET_STATUS, VIDEO_CUE_POINT</code>, and <code>PLAY_PROGRESS</code> in addition 
 * to the typical loader events, making it easy to hook up your own control interface. It packs a 
 * surprising amount of functionality into a very small amount of kb.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>OPTIONAL VARS PROPERTIES</strong></p>
 * <p>The following special properties can be passed into the VideoLoader constructor via its <code>vars</code> 
 * parameter which can be either a generic object or a <code><a href="data/VideoLoaderVars.html">VideoLoaderVars</a></code> object:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 		<li><strong> name : String</strong> - A name that is used to identify the VideoLoader instance. This name can be fed to the <code>LoaderMax.getLoader()</code> or <code>LoaderMax.getContent()</code> methods or traced at any time. Each loader's name should be unique. If you don't define one, a unique name will be created automatically, like "loader21".</li>
 * 		<li><strong> bufferTime : Number</strong> - The amount of time (in seconds) that should be buffered before the video can begin playing (set <code>autoPlay</code> to <code>false</code> to pause the video initially).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> autoPlay : Boolean</strong> - By default, the video will begin playing as soon as it has been adequately buffered, but to prevent it from playing initially, set <code>autoPlay</code> to <code>false</code>.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> smoothing : Boolean</strong> - When <code>smoothing</code> is <code>true</code> (the default), smoothing will be enabled for the video which typically leads to better scaling results.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> container : DisplayObjectContainer</strong> - A DisplayObjectContainer into which the <code>ContentDisplay</code> should be added immediately.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> width : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>width</code> property (applied before rotation, scaleX, and scaleY).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> height : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>height</code> property (applied before rotation, scaleX, and scaleY).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> centerRegistration : Boolean </strong> - if <code>true</code>, the registration point will be placed in the center of the <code>ContentDisplay</code> which can be useful if, for example, you want to animate its scale and have it grow/shrink from its center.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> scaleMode : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>scaleMode</code> controls how the video will be scaled to fit the area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.ScaleMode</code> constants if you prefer):
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li><code>"stretch"</code> (the default) - The video will fill the width/height exactly.</li>
 * 				<li><code>"proportionalInside"</code> - The video will be scaled proportionally to fit inside the area defined by the width/height</li>
 * 				<li><code>"proportionalOutside"</code> - The video will be scaled proportionally to completely fill the area, allowing portions of it to exceed the bounds defined by the width/height.</li>
 * 				<li><code>"widthOnly"</code> - Only the width of the video will be adjusted to fit.</li>
 * 				<li><code>"heightOnly"</code> - Only the height of the video will be adjusted to fit.</li>
 * 				<li><code>"none"</code> - No scaling of the video will occur.</li>
 * 			</ul></li>
 * 		<li><strong> hAlign : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>hAlign</code> determines how the video is horizontally aligned within that area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.AlignMode</code> constants if you prefer):
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li><code>"center"</code> (the default) - The video will be centered horizontally in the area</li>
 * 				<li><code>"left"</code> - The video will be aligned with the left side of the area</li>
 * 				<li><code>"right"</code> - The video will be aligned with the right side of the area</li>
 * 			</ul></li>
 * 		<li><strong> vAlign : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>vAlign</code> determines how the video is vertically aligned within that area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.AlignMode</code> constants if you prefer):
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li><code>"center"</code> (the default) - The video will be centered vertically in the area</li>
 * 				<li><code>"top"</code> - The video will be aligned with the top of the area</li>
 * 				<li><code>"bottom"</code> - The video will be aligned with the bottom of the area</li>
 * 			</ul></li>
 * 		<li><strong> crop : Boolean</strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, setting <code>crop</code> to <code>true</code> will cause the video to be cropped within that area (by applying a <code>scrollRect</code> for maximum performance). This is typically useful when the <code>scaleMode</code> is <code>"proportionalOutside"</code> or <code>"none"</code> so that any parts of the video that exceed the dimensions defined by <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are visually chopped off. Use the <code>hAlign</code> and <code>vAlign</code> special properties to control the vertical and horizontal alignment within the cropped area.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> x : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>x</code> property (for positioning on the stage).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> y : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>y</code> property (for positioning on the stage).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> scaleX : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>scaleX</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> scaleY : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>scaleY</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> rotation : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>rotation</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> alpha : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>alpha</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> visible : Boolean</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>visible</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> blendMode : String</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>blendMode</code> property.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> bgColor : uint </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, a rectangle will be drawn inside the <code>ContentDisplay</code> immediately in order to ease the development process. It is transparent by default, but you may define a <code>bgAlpha</code> if you prefer.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> bgAlpha : Number </strong> - Controls the alpha of the rectangle that is drawn when a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> volume : Number</strong> - A value between 0 and 1 indicating the volume at which the video should play (default is 1).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> repeat : int</strong> - Number of times that the video should repeat. To repeat indefinitely, use -1. Default is 0.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> stageVideo : StageVideo</strong> - By default, the NetStream gets attached to a <code>Video</code> object, but if you want to use StageVideo in Flash, you can define the <code>stageVideo</code> property and VideoLoader will attach its NetStream to that StageVideo instance instead of the regular Video instance (which is the <code>rawContent</code>). Please read Adobe's docs regarding StageVideo to understand the benefits, tradeoffs and limitations.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> checkPolicyFile : Boolean</strong> - If <code>true</code>, the VideoLoader will check for a crossdomain.xml file on the remote host (only useful when loading videos from other domains - see Adobe's docs for details about NetStream's <code>checkPolicyFile</code> property). </li>
 * 		<li><strong> estimatedDuration : Number</strong> - Estimated duration of the video in seconds. VideoLoader will only use this value until it receives the necessary metaData from the video in order to accurately determine the video's duration. You do not need to specify an <code>estimatedDuration</code>, but doing so can help make the playProgress and some other values more accurate (until the metaData has loaded). It can also make the <code>progress/bytesLoaded/bytesTotal</code> more accurate when a <code>estimatedDuration</code> is defined, particularly in <code>bufferMode</code>.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> deblocking : int</strong> - Indicates the type of filter applied to decoded video as part of post-processing. The default value is 0, which lets the video compressor apply a deblocking filter as needed. See Adobe's <code>flash.media.Video</code> class docs for details.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> bufferMode : Boolean </strong> - When <code>true</code>, the loader will report its progress only in terms of the video's buffer which can be very convenient if, for example, you want to display loading progress for the video's buffer or tuck it into a LoaderMax with other loaders and allow the LoaderMax to dispatch its <code>COMPLETE</code> event when the buffer is full instead of waiting for the whole file to download. When <code>bufferMode</code> is <code>true</code>, the VideoLoader will dispatch its <code>COMPLETE</code> event when the buffer is full as opposed to waiting for the entire video to load. You can toggle the <code>bufferMode</code> anytime. Please read the full <code>bufferMode</code> property ASDoc description below for details about how it affects things like <code>bytesTotal</code>.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> autoAdjustBuffer : Boolean </strong> If the buffer becomes empty during playback and <code>autoAdjustBuffer</code> is <code>true</code> (the default), it will automatically attempt to adjust the NetStream's <code>bufferTime</code> based on the rate at which the video has been loading, estimating what it needs to be in order to play the rest of the video without emptying the buffer again. This can prevent the annoying problem of video playback start/stopping/starting/stopping on a system tht doesn't have enough bandwidth to adequately buffer the video. You may also set the <code>bufferTime</code> in the constructor's <code>vars</code> parameter to set the initial value.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> autoDetachNetStream : Boolean</strong> - If <code>true</code>, the NetStream will only be attached to the Video object (the <code>rawContent</code>) when it is in the display list (on the stage). This conserves memory but it can cause a very brief rendering delay when the content is initially added to the stage (often imperceptible). Also, if you add it to the stage when the <code>videoTime</code> is <i>after</i> its last encoded keyframe, it will render at that last keyframe.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> alternateURL : String</strong> - If you define an <code>alternateURL</code>, the loader will initially try to load from its original <code>url</code> and if it fails, it will automatically (and permanently) change the loader's <code>url</code> to the <code>alternateURL</code> and try again. Think of it as a fallback or backup <code>url</code>. It is perfectly acceptable to use the same <code>alternateURL</code> for multiple loaders (maybe a default image for various ImageLoaders for example).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> noCache : Boolean</strong> - If <code>noCache</code> is <code>true</code>, a "gsCacheBusterID" parameter will be appended to the url with a random set of numbers to prevent caching (don't worry, this info is ignored when you <code>getLoader()</code> or <code>getContent()</code> by url and when you're running locally)</li>
 * 		<li><strong> estimatedBytes : uint</strong> - Initially, the loader's <code>bytesTotal</code> is set to the <code>estimatedBytes</code> value (or <code>LoaderMax.defaultEstimatedBytes</code> if one isn't defined). Then, when the loader begins loading and it can accurately determine the bytesTotal, it will do so. Setting <code>estimatedBytes</code> is optional, but the more accurate the value, the more accurate your loaders' overall progress will be initially. If the loader will be inserted into a LoaderMax instance (for queue management), its <code>auditSize</code> feature can attempt to automatically determine the <code>bytesTotal</code> at runtime (there is a slight performance penalty for this, however - see LoaderMax's documentation for details).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> requireWithRoot : DisplayObject</strong> - LoaderMax supports <i>subloading</i>, where an object can be factored into a parent's loading progress. If you want LoaderMax to require this VideoLoader as part of its parent SWFLoader's progress, you must set the <code>requireWithRoot</code> property to your swf's <code>root</code>. For example, <code>var loader:VideoLoader = new VideoLoader("myScript.php", {name:"textData", requireWithRoot:this.root});</code></li>
 * 		<li><strong> allowMalformedURL : Boolean</strong> - Normally, the URL will be parsed and any variables in the query string (like "?name=test&amp;state=il&amp;gender=m") will be placed into a URLVariables object which is added to the URLRequest. This avoids a few bugs in Flash, but if you need to keep the entire URL intact (no parsing into URLVariables), set <code>allowMalformedURL:true</code>. For example, if your URL has duplicate variables in the query string like <code>http://www.greensock.com/?c=S&amp;c=SE&amp;c=SW</code>, it is technically considered a malformed URL and a URLVariables object can't properly contain all the duplicates, so in this case you'd want to set <code>allowMalformedURL</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> autoDispose : Boolean</strong> - When <code>autoDispose</code> is <code>true</code>, the loader will be disposed immediately after it completes (it calls the <code>dispose()</code> method internally after dispatching its <code>COMPLETE</code> event). This will remove any listeners that were defined in the vars object (like onComplete, onProgress, onError, onInit). Once a loader is disposed, it can no longer be found with <code>LoaderMax.getLoader()</code> or <code>LoaderMax.getContent()</code> - it is essentially destroyed but its content is not unloaded (you must call <code>unload()</code> or <code>dispose(true)</code> to unload its content). The default <code>autoDispose</code> value is <code>false</code>.
 * 		
 * 		<p>----EVENT HANDLER SHORTCUTS----</p></li>
 * 		<li><strong> onOpen : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.OPEN</code> events which are dispatched when the loader begins loading. Make sure your onOpen function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onInit : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>Event.INIT</code> events which will be called when the video's metaData has been received and the video is placed into the <code>ContentDisplay</code>. The <code>INIT</code> event can be dispatched more than once if the NetStream receives metaData more than once (which occasionally happens, particularly with F4V files - the first time often doesn't include the cuePoints). Make sure your <code>onInit</code> function accepts a single parameter of type <code>Event</code> (flash.events.Event).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onProgress : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.PROGRESS</code> events which are dispatched whenever the <code>bytesLoaded</code> changes. Make sure your onProgress function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>). You can use the LoaderEvent's <code>target.progress</code> to get the loader's progress value or use its <code>target.bytesLoaded</code> and <code>target.bytesTotal</code>.</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onComplete : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.COMPLETE</code> events which are dispatched when the loader has finished loading successfully. Make sure your onComplete function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onCancel : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.CANCEL</code> events which are dispatched when loading is aborted due to either a failure or because another loader was prioritized or <code>cancel()</code> was manually called. Make sure your onCancel function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onError : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.ERROR</code> events which are dispatched whenever the loader experiences an error (typically an IO_ERROR). An error doesn't necessarily mean the loader failed, however - to listen for when a loader fails, use the <code>onFail</code> special property. Make sure your onError function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onFail : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.FAIL</code> events which are dispatched whenever the loader fails and its <code>status</code> changes to <code>LoaderStatus.FAILED</code>. Make sure your onFail function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * 		<li><strong> onIOError : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.IO_ERROR</code> events which will also call the onError handler, so you can use that as more of a catch-all whereas <code>onIOError</code> is specifically for LoaderEvent.IO_ERROR events. Make sure your onIOError function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using a <code><a href="data/VideoLoaderVars.html">VideoLoaderVars</a></code> instance 
 * instead of a generic object to define your <code>vars</code> is a bit more verbose but provides 
 * code hinting and improved debugging because it enforces strict data typing. Use whichever one you prefer.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid garbage collection issues in the Flash player, the <code>netStream</code> 
 * object that VideoLoader employs must get recreated internally anytime the VideoLoader is unloaded or its loading 
 * is cancelled, so if you need to directly access the <code>netStream</code>, it is best to do so <strong>after</strong>
 * the <code>COMPLETE</code> event has been dispatched. Otherwise, if you store a reference to the VideoLoader's 
 * <code>netStream</code> before or during a load and it gets cancelled or unloaded for some reason, it won't reference 
 * the one that was used to load the video.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a bug/inconsistency in Adobe's NetStream class that causes relative URLs 
 * to use the swf's location as the base path instead of the HTML page's location like all other loaders. Therefore,
 * it would be wise to use the "base" attribute of the &lt;OBJECT&gt; and &lt;EMBED&gt; tags in the HTML to 
 * make sure all relative paths are consistent. See <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/041/tn_04157.html" target="_blank">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/041/tn_04157.html</a>
 * for details.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to minimize memory usage, VideoLoader doesn't attach the NetStream to its Video
 * object (the <code>rawContent</code>) until it is added to the display list. Therefore, if your VideoLoader's content
 * isn't somewhere on the stage, the NetStream's visual content won't be fully decoded into memory (that's a good thing). 
 * The only time this could be of consequence is if you are trying to do a BitmapData.draw() of the VideoLoader's content 
 * or rawContent when it isn't on the stage. In that case, you'd just need to attach the NetStream manually before doing 
 * your BitmapData.draw() like <code>myVideoLoader.rawContent.attachNetStream(myVideoLoader.netStream)</code>. </p>

		 * Constructor
		 * 
		 * @param urlOrRequest The url (<code>String</code>) or <code>URLRequest</code> from which the loader should get its content.
		 * @param vars An object containing optional configuration details. For example: <code>new VideoLoader("video/video.flv", {name:"myVideo", onComplete:completeHandler, onProgress:progressHandler})</code>.
		 * 
		 * <p>The following special properties can be passed into the constructor via the <code>vars</code> parameter
		 * which can be either a generic object or a <code><a href="data/VideoLoaderVars.html">VideoLoaderVars</a></code> object:</p>
		 * <ul>
		 * 		<li><strong> name : String</strong> - A name that is used to identify the VideoLoader instance. This name can be fed to the <code>LoaderMax.getLoader()</code> or <code>LoaderMax.getContent()</code> methods or traced at any time. Each loader's name should be unique. If you don't define one, a unique name will be created automatically, like "loader21".</li>

		 * 		<li><strong> smoothing : Boolean</strong> - When <code>smoothing</code> is <code>true</code> (the default), smoothing will be enabled for the video which typically leads to better scaling results.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> container : DisplayObjectContainer</strong> - A DisplayObjectContainer into which the <code>ContentDisplay</code> should be added immediately.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> width : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>width</code> property (applied before rotation, scaleX, and scaleY).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> height : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>height</code> property (applied before rotation, scaleX, and scaleY).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> centerRegistration : Boolean </strong> - if <code>true</code>, the registration point will be placed in the center of the <code>ContentDisplay</code> which can be useful if, for example, you want to animate its scale and have it grow/shrink from its center.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> scaleMode : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>scaleMode</code> controls how the video will be scaled to fit the area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.ScaleMode</code> constants if you prefer):
		 * 			<ul>
		 * 				<li><code>"stretch"</code> (the default) - The video will fill the width/height exactly.</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"proportionalInside"</code> - The video will be scaled proportionally to fit inside the area defined by the width/height</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"proportionalOutside"</code> - The video will be scaled proportionally to completely fill the area, allowing portions of it to exceed the bounds defined by the width/height.</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"widthOnly"</code> - Only the width of the video will be adjusted to fit.</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"heightOnly"</code> - Only the height of the video will be adjusted to fit.</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"none"</code> - No scaling of the video will occur.</li>
		 * 			</ul></li>
		 * 		<li><strong> hAlign : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>hAlign</code> determines how the video is horizontally aligned within that area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.AlignMode</code> constants if you prefer):
		 * 			<ul>
		 * 				<li><code>"center"</code> (the default) - The video will be centered horizontally in the area</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"left"</code> - The video will be aligned with the left side of the area</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"right"</code> - The video will be aligned with the right side of the area</li>
		 * 			</ul></li>
		 * 		<li><strong> vAlign : String </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, the <code>vAlign</code> determines how the video is vertically aligned within that area. The following values are recognized (you may use the <code>com.greensock.v12.layout.AlignMode</code> constants if you prefer):
		 * 			<ul>
		 * 				<li><code>"center"</code> (the default) - The video will be centered vertically in the area</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"top"</code> - The video will be aligned with the top of the area</li>
		 * 				<li><code>"bottom"</code> - The video will be aligned with the bottom of the area</li>
		 * 			</ul></li>
		 * 		<li><strong> crop : Boolean</strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, setting <code>crop</code> to <code>true</code> will cause the video to be cropped within that area (by applying a <code>scrollRect</code> for maximum performance). This is typically useful when the <code>scaleMode</code> is <code>"proportionalOutside"</code> or <code>"none"</code> so that any parts of the video that exceed the dimensions defined by <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are visually chopped off. Use the <code>hAlign</code> and <code>vAlign</code> special properties to control the vertical and horizontal alignment within the cropped area.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> x : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>x</code> property (for positioning on the stage).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> y : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>y</code> property (for positioning on the stage).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> scaleX : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>scaleX</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> scaleY : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>scaleY</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> rotation : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>rotation</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> alpha : Number</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>alpha</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> visible : Boolean</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>visible</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> blendMode : String</strong> - Sets the <code>ContentDisplay</code>'s <code>blendMode</code> property.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> bgColor : uint </strong> - When a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined, a rectangle will be drawn inside the <code>ContentDisplay</code> immediately in order to ease the development process. It is transparent by default, but you may define a <code>bgAlpha</code> if you prefer.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> bgAlpha : Number </strong> - Controls the alpha of the rectangle that is drawn when a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are defined.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> volume : Number</strong> - A value between 0 and 1 indicating the volume at which the video should play (default is 1).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> repeat : int</strong> - Number of times that the video should repeat. To repeat indefinitely, use -1. Default is 0.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> stageVideo : StageVideo</strong> - By default, the NetStream gets attached to a <code>Video</code> object, but if you want to use StageVideo in Flash, you can define the <code>stageVideo</code> property and VideoLoader will attach its NetStream to that StageVideo instance instead of the regular Video instance (which is the <code>rawContent</code>). Please read Adobe's docs regarding StageVideo to understand the benefits, tradeoffs and limitations.</li>		
		 * 		<li><strong> checkPolicyFile : Boolean</strong> - If <code>true</code>, the VideoLoader will check for a crossdomain.xml file on the remote host (only useful when loading videos from other domains - see Adobe's docs for details about NetStream's <code>checkPolicyFile</code> property). </li>
		 * 		<li><strong> estimatedDuration : Number</strong> - Estimated duration of the video in seconds. VideoLoader will only use this value until it receives the necessary metaData from the video in order to accurately determine the video's duration. You do not need to specify an <code>estimatedDuration</code>, but doing so can help make the playProgress and some other values more accurate (until the metaData has loaded). It can also make the <code>progress/bytesLoaded/bytesTotal</code> more accurate when a <code>estimatedDuration</code> is defined, particularly in <code>bufferMode</code>.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> deblocking : int</strong> - Indicates the type of filter applied to decoded video as part of post-processing. The default value is 0, which lets the video compressor apply a deblocking filter as needed. See Adobe's <code>flash.media.Video</code> class docs for details.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> bufferMode : Boolean </strong> - When <code>true</code>, the loader will report its progress only in terms of the video's buffer which can be very convenient if, for example, you want to display loading progress for the video's buffer or tuck it into a LoaderMax with other loaders and allow the LoaderMax to dispatch its <code>COMPLETE</code> event when the buffer is full instead of waiting for the whole file to download. When <code>bufferMode</code> is <code>true</code>, the VideoLoader will dispatch its <code>COMPLETE</code> event when the buffer is full as opposed to waiting for the entire video to load. You can toggle the <code>bufferMode</code> anytime. Please read the full <code>bufferMode</code> property ASDoc description below for details about how it affects things like <code>bytesTotal</code>.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> autoAdjustBuffer : Boolean </strong> If the buffer becomes empty during playback and <code>autoAdjustBuffer</code> is <code>true</code> (the default), it will automatically attempt to adjust the NetStream's <code>bufferTime</code> based on the rate at which the video has been loading, estimating what it needs to be in order to play the rest of the video without emptying the buffer again. This can prevent the annoying problem of video playback start/stopping/starting/stopping on a system tht doesn't have enough bandwidth to adequately buffer the video. You may also set the <code>bufferTime</code> in the constructor's <code>vars</code> parameter to set the initial value.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> autoDetachNetStream : Boolean</strong> - If <code>true</code>, the NetStream will only be attached to the Video object (the <code>rawContent</code>) when it is in the display list (on the stage). This conserves memory but it can cause a very brief rendering delay when the content is initially added to the stage (often imperceptible). Also, if you add it to the stage when the <code>videoTime</code> is <i>after</i> its last encoded keyframe, it will render at that last keyframe.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> alternateURL : String</strong> - If you define an <code>alternateURL</code>, the loader will initially try to load from its original <code>url</code> and if it fails, it will automatically (and permanently) change the loader's <code>url</code> to the <code>alternateURL</code> and try again. Think of it as a fallback or backup <code>url</code>. It is perfectly acceptable to use the same <code>alternateURL</code> for multiple loaders (maybe a default image for various ImageLoaders for example).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> noCache : Boolean</strong> - If <code>noCache</code> is <code>true</code>, a "gsCacheBusterID" parameter will be appended to the url with a random set of numbers to prevent caching (don't worry, this info is ignored when you <code>getLoader()</code> or <code>getContent()</code> by url and when you're running locally)</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> estimatedBytes : uint</strong> - Initially, the loader's <code>bytesTotal</code> is set to the <code>estimatedBytes</code> value (or <code>LoaderMax.defaultEstimatedBytes</code> if one isn't defined). Then, when the loader begins loading and it can accurately determine the bytesTotal, it will do so. Setting <code>estimatedBytes</code> is optional, but the more accurate the value, the more accurate your loaders' overall progress will be initially. If the loader will be inserted into a LoaderMax instance (for queue management), its <code>auditSize</code> feature can attempt to automatically determine the <code>bytesTotal</code> at runtime (there is a slight performance penalty for this, however - see LoaderMax's documentation for details).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> requireWithRoot : DisplayObject</strong> - LoaderMax supports <i>subloading</i>, where an object can be factored into a parent's loading progress. If you want LoaderMax to require this VideoLoader as part of its parent SWFLoader's progress, you must set the <code>requireWithRoot</code> property to your swf's <code>root</code>. For example, <code>var loader:VideoLoader = new VideoLoader("myScript.php", {name:"textData", requireWithRoot:this.root});</code></li>
		 * 		<li><strong> allowMalformedURL : Boolean</strong> - Normally, the URL will be parsed and any variables in the query string (like "?name=test&amp;state=il&amp;gender=m") will be placed into a URLVariables object which is added to the URLRequest. This avoids a few bugs in Flash, but if you need to keep the entire URL intact (no parsing into URLVariables), set <code>allowMalformedURL:true</code>. For example, if your URL has duplicate variables in the query string like <code>http://www.greensock.com/?c=S&amp;c=SE&amp;c=SW</code>, it is technically considered a malformed URL and a URLVariables object can't properly contain all the duplicates, so in this case you'd want to set <code>allowMalformedURL</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> autoDispose : Boolean</strong> - When <code>autoDispose</code> is <code>true</code>, the loader will be disposed immediately after it completes (it calls the <code>dispose()</code> method internally after dispatching its <code>COMPLETE</code> event). This will remove any listeners that were defined in the vars object (like onComplete, onProgress, onError, onInit). Once a loader is disposed, it can no longer be found with <code>LoaderMax.getLoader()</code> or <code>LoaderMax.getContent()</code> - it is essentially destroyed but its content is not unloaded (you must call <code>unload()</code> or <code>dispose(true)</code> to unload its content). The default <code>autoDispose</code> value is <code>false</code>.
		 * 		
		 * 		<p>----EVENT HANDLER SHORTCUTS----</p></li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onOpen : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.OPEN</code> events which are dispatched when the loader begins loading. Make sure your onOpen function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onInit : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>Event.INIT</code> events which will be called when the video's metaData has been received and the video is placed into the <code>ContentDisplay</code>. The <code>INIT</code> event can be dispatched more than once if the NetStream receives metaData more than once (which occasionally happens, particularly with F4V files - the first time often doesn't include the cuePoints). Make sure your <code>onInit</code> function accepts a single parameter of type <code>Event</code> (flash.events.Event).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onProgress : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.PROGRESS</code> events which are dispatched whenever the <code>bytesLoaded</code> changes. Make sure your onProgress function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>). You can use the LoaderEvent's <code>target.progress</code> to get the loader's progress value or use its <code>target.bytesLoaded</code> and <code>target.bytesTotal</code>.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onComplete : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.COMPLETE</code> events which are dispatched when the loader has finished loading successfully. Make sure your onComplete function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onCancel : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.CANCEL</code> events which are dispatched when loading is aborted due to either a failure or because another loader was prioritized or <code>cancel()</code> was manually called. Make sure your onCancel function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onError : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.ERROR</code> events which are dispatched whenever the loader experiences an error (typically an IO_ERROR). An error doesn't necessarily mean the loader failed, however - to listen for when a loader fails, use the <code>onFail</code> special property. Make sure your onError function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onFail : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.FAIL</code> events which are dispatched whenever the loader fails and its <code>status</code> changes to <code>LoaderStatus.FAILED</code>. Make sure your onFail function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
		 * 		<li><strong> onIOError : Function</strong> - A handler function for <code>LoaderEvent.IO_ERROR</code> events which will also call the onError handler, so you can use that as more of a catch-all whereas <code>onIOError</code> is specifically for LoaderEvent.IO_ERROR events. Make sure your onIOError function accepts a single parameter of type <code>LoaderEvent</code> (<code>com.greensock.v12.events.LoaderEvent</code>).</li>
