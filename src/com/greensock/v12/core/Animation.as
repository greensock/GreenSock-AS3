 * Base class for all TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and TimelineMax classes, providing
 * core methods/properties/functionality, but there is no reason to create an instance of this 
 * class directly. It can be very useful, however, as a data type in AS3/AS2 for methods/properties that 
 * can contain tweens or timelines. For example, maybe you build an <code>animateIn()</code> and 
 * <code>animateOut()</code> method for many of your own custom classes, and they each return an 
 * Animation instance which could be a tween or a timeline:
 * 
 * <listing version="3.0">
function animateIn():Animation {
	return TweenLite.to(this, 1, {scaleX:1, scaleY:1, autoAlpha:1});
}
 
function animateOut():Animation {
	var tl:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite();
	tl.to(this, 1, {scaleX:0.5, scaleY:0.5});
	tl.to(this, 0.5, {autoAlpha:0}, "-=0.25");
	return tl;
}

var anim:Animation = animateIn();

//now we can control the animation with the common methods:
anim.pause();
anim.play();
anim.reverse();

//or somewhere else, we could build a sequence like this:
var tl:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite();
tl.add( animateIn() );
tl.add( animateOut(), 3);

		/** @private **/
		public static const version:String = "12.0.7";
		
		/**
		 * The object that dispatches a <code>"tick"</code> event each time the engine updates, making it easy for 
		 * you to add your own listener(s) to run custom logic after each update (great for game developers).
		 * Add as many listeners as you want. The basic syntax is the same for all versions (AS2, AS3, and JavaScript):
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>Basic example (AS2, AS3, and JavaScript):</strong></p><listing version="3.0">
//add listener
Animation.ticker.addEventListener("tick", myFunction);

function myFunction(event) {
    //executes on every tick after the core engine updates
}

//to remove the listener later...
Animation.ticker.removeEventListener("tick", myFunction);
</listing>
		 * 
		 * <p>Due to differences in the core languages (and to maximize efficiency), the advanced syntax is slightly different
		 * for the AS3 version compared to AS2 and JavaScript. The parameters beyond the first 2 in the addEventListener() 
		 * method are outlined below:</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>JavaScript and AS2</strong></p>
		 * <p><code>addEventListener(type, callback, scope, useParam, priority)</code></p>
		 * <p>Parameters:
		 * <ol>
		 * 		<li><strong>type</strong> <em>: String</em> - type of listener, should always be <code>"tick"</code></li>
		 * 		<li><strong>callback</strong> <em>: Function</em> - the function to call when the event occurs</li>
		 * 		<li><strong>scope</strong> <em>: Object</em> - binds the scope to a particular object (scope is basically what "<code>this</code>" refers to in your function). This can be very useful in JavaScript and AS2 because scope isn't generally maintained. </li>
		 * 		<li><strong>useParam</strong> <em>: Boolean</em> - if <code>true</code>, an event object will be generated and fed to the callback each time the event occurs. The event is a generic object and has two properties: <code>type</code> (always <code>"tick"</code>) and <code>target</code> which refers to the ticker instance. The default for <code>useParam</code> is <code>false</code> because it improves performance.</li>
		 * 		<li><strong>priority</strong> <em>: Integer</em> - influences the order in which the listeners are called. Listeners with lower priorities are called after ones with higher priorities.</li>
		 * </ol>
		 * </p>
		 * 
		 * <p>In JavaScript, the Animation object/class is located at <code>com.greensock.v12.core.Animation</code> - it is not added to the global namespace in order to avoid polluting it (developers rarely directly access the Animation class)</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>Advanced example (JavaScript and AS2):</strong></p><listing version="3.0">
//add listener that requests an event object parameter, binds scope to the current scope (this), and sets priority to 1 so that it is called before any other listeners that had a priority lower than 1...
Animation.ticker.addEventListener("tick", myFunction, this, true, 1);

function myFunction(event) {
    //executes on every tick after the core engine updates
}

//to remove the listener later...
Animation.ticker.removeEventListener("tick", myFunction);
</listing>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>AS3</strong></p>
		 * <p>The AS3 version uses the standard <code>EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</code> syntax which 
		 * basically allows you to define a priority and whether or not to use weak references (see Adobe's 
		 * docs for details).</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>Advanced example [AS3 only]:</strong></p><listing version="3.0">
import flash.events.Event;

//add listener with weak reference (standard syntax - notice the 5th parameter is true)
Animation.ticker.addEventListener("tick", myFunction, false, 0, true);
