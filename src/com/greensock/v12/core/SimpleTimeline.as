		 * in order to maintain smooth playback when properties are changed on-the-fly. For example, imagine that 
		 * the timeline's playhead is on a child tween that is 75% complete, moving mc.x from 0 to 100 and then 
		 * that tween's <code>reverse()</code> method is called. If <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>false</code> 
		 * (the default except for the root timelines), the tween would flip in place, keeping its <code>startTime</code> 
		 * consistent. Therefore the playhead of the timeline would now be at the tween's 25% completion point instead 
		 * of 75%. Remember, the timeline's playhead position and direction are unaffected by child tween/timeline changes.
		 * mc.x would jump from 75 to 25, but the tween's position in the timeline would remain consistent. 
		 * However, if <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>true</code>, that child tween's <code>startTime</code> would
		 * be adjusted so that the timeline's playhead intersects with the same spot on the tween (75% complete) as it had 
		 * immediately before <code>reverse()</code> was called, thus playback appears perfectly smooth. mc.x would 
		 * still be 75 and it would continue from there as the playhead moves on, but since the tween is reversed now
		 * mc.x will travel back towards 0 instead of 100. Ultimately it's a decision between prioritizing smooth 
		 * on-the-fly playback (<code>true</code>) or consistent position(s) of child tweens/timelines (<code>false</code>). 
		 * 
		 * <p>Some examples of on-the-fly changes to child tweens/timelines that could cause their <code>startTime</code>
		 * to change when <code>smoothChildTiming</code> is <code>true</code> are: <code>reversed, timeScale, progress, 
		 * totalProgress, time, totalTime, delay, pause, resume, duration,</code> and <code>totalDuration</code>.</p>
