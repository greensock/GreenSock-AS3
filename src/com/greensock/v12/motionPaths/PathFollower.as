/**
 * [AS3 only] A PathFollower is used to associate a particular target object (like a MovieClip, Point, Sprite, etc.) 
 * with a MotionPath and it offers a tweenable <code>progress</code> property that manages positioning
 * the target on the path accordingly. The <code>progress</code> property is a value between
 * 0 and 1 where 0 is at the beginning of the path, 0.5 is in the middle, and 1 is at the end. 
 * When the follower's <code>autoRotate</code> property is <code>true</code>, the target will be
 * rotated in relation to the path that it is following.

 * <p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>All followers are automatically updated when you alter the MotionPath that they're following.</li>
 * 		<li>To tween all followers along the path at once, simply tween the MotionPath's <code>progress</code> 
 * 			property which will provide better performance than tweening each follower independently.</li>

		 * You can tween to values that are greater than 1 or less than 0 but the values are simply wrapped. 
		 * So, for example, setting <code>progress</code> to 1.2 is the same as setting it to 0.2 and -0.2 is the

		 * is set to -3.4, <code>progress</code> would be 0.6. <code>rawProgress</code> can be useful if 
		 * you need to find out how many times the PathFollower has wrapped.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>Also note that if you set <code>progress</code> to any value <i>outside</i> of the 0-1 range, 
		 * <code>rawProgress</code> will be set to that exact value. If <code>progress</code> is
		 * set to a value <i>within</i> the typical 0-1 range, it will only affect the decimal value of 
		 * <code>rawProgress</code>. For example, if <code>rawProgress</code> is 3.4 and then you 
		 * set <code>progress</code> to 0.1, <code>rawProgress</code> will end up at 3.1 (notice
		 * the "3" integer was kept). But if <code>progress</code> was instead set to 5.1, since
		 * it exceeds the 0-1 range, <code>rawProgress</code> would become 5.1. This behavior was 
		 * adopted in order to deal most effectively with wrapping situations. For example, if 
		 * <code>rawProgress</code> was tweened to 3.4 and then later you wanted to fine-tune
		 * where things were positioned by tweening <code>progress</code> to 0.8, it still may be
		 * important to be able to determine how many loops/wraps occurred, so <code>rawProgress</code>
		 * should be 3.8, not reset to 0.8. Feel free to use <code>rawProgress</code> exclusively if you 
		 * prefer to avoid any of the re-interpolation that occurs with <code>progress</code>.</p>
