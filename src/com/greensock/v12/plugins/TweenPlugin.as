/**
 * TweenPlugin is the base class for all TweenLite and TweenMax plugins, but generally isn't used directly. 
 * 	
 * <p><strong>USAGE:</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>To create your own plugin, extend TweenPlugin and override whichever methods you need. Typically,
 * you only need to override <code>_onInitTween()</code> (which is called when the tween renders for
 * the first time) and <code>setRatio()</code> (which is called on every update and passes a progress 
 * parameter which is typically a value between 0 and 1, but changes according to the ease). I'd recommend 
 * looking at a simple plugin like ScalePlugin and using it as a template of sorts. There are a few 
 * key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 	<li> Pass the TweenPlugin constructor a comma-delimited list of property names that the plugin should
 * 		overwrite, the first of which should be the property name that the plugin intercepts. For example, 
 * 		the ScalePlugin handles any tweens of <code>"scale"</code> and it also overwrites other concurrent 
 * 		tweens that are handling the "scale", "scaleX", and/or "scaleY" properties of the target. Therefore, 
 * 		in ScalePlugin's constructor, we'd call <code>super("scale,scaleX,scaleY")</code>. The first name
 * 		in the list must be unique - two plugins cannot handle the same primary property. </li>
 * 		
 * 	<li> When a tween that uses your plugin initializes its tween values (normally when it renders the 
 * 		first time), a new instance of your plugin will be created and the <code>_onInitTween()</code> method 
 * 		is called. That's where you'll want to record any initial values and prepare for the tween. 
 * 		<code>_onInitTween()</code> should return a Boolean value that essentially indicates whether 
 * 		or not the plugin initted successfully. If you return false, TweenLite/Max  will just use a 
 * 		normal tween for the value, ignoring the plugin for that particular tween. For example,
 * 		maybe your tween only works with MovieClips, so if the target isn't a MovieClip you could 
 * 		return <code>false</code></li>
 * 		  
 * 	<li> The <code>setRatio()</code> method will be called on every frame during the course of the tween 
 * 		and it will be passed a single parameter that's a multiplier (typically between 0 and 1, according
 * 		to the ease) describing the total amount of change from the beginning of the tween (0). It will be 
 * 		zero at the beginning of the tween and 1 at the end, but inbetween it could be any value based on the 
 * 		ease applied (for example, an <code>ElasticOut</code> ease would cause the value to shoot past 1 and 
 * 		back again before the end of the tween). So if the tween uses the <code>Linear.ease</code>, when it's 
 * 		halfway finished, the <code>setRatio()</code> will receive a parameter of 0.5.</li>
 * 		  
 * 	<li> The <code>_overwriteProps</code> is an array that should contain the properties that your 
 * 		plugin should overwrite in <code>"auto"</code> mode. For example, the <code>autoAlpha</code> 
 * 		plugin controls the <code>"visible"</code> and <code>"alpha"</code> properties of an object, 
 * 		so if another tween is created that controls the <code>alpha</code> of the target object, 
 * 		your plugin's <code>_kill()</code> method will be called which should handle killing the 
 * 		<code>"alpha"</code> part of the tween. It is your responsibility to populate (and depopulate) 
 * 		the <code>_overwriteProps</code> Array. Failure to do so properly can cause odd overwriting 
 * 		behavior.</li>
 * 		  
 * 	<li> There's a <code>_roundProps()</code> method that gets called by the RoundPropsPlugin if the
 * 		user requests that certain properties get rounded to the nearest integer. If you use 
 * 		<code>_addTween()</code> method to add property tweens, rounding will happen automatically 
 * 		(if necessary), but if you don't use <code>_addTween()</code> and prefer to manually calculate 
 * 		tween values in your <code>setRatio()</code> method, just remember to override the <code>_roundProps()</code>
 * 		method if that makes sense in your plugin (some plugins wouldn't need to accommodate rounding, like color
 * 		plugins).</li>
 * 
 * 	<li> If you need to run a function when the tween gets disabled, add an <code>_onDisable()</code> method
 * 		(named exactly that) to your plugin. It will automatically be called when the tween gets disabled (typically
 * 		when it finishes and is removed from its parent timeline). Same for <code>_onEnable()</code> if you 
 * 		need to run code when a tween is enabled. These methods should return a Boolean value indicating 
 * 		whether or not they changed any properties on the target becaues if so (<code>true</code>), it helps
 * 		notify any initting tweens of the same target to re-init. It is very rare that an <code>_onDisable()</code>
 * 		or <code>_onEnable()</code> method is necessary, but it can be useful for things like MotionBlurPlugin
 * 		which must do some very advanced things, hiding the target, changing its alpha to almost 0, etc. only
 * 		while the tween occurs. If another alpha tween of that same target overwrites an existing motionBlur
 * 		of the same target, the alpha would be at the wrong value normally, but the if the <code>_onDisable()</code>
 * 		returns <code>true</code>, it would force the new tween to re-init AFTER the alpha was fixed inside
 * 		the <code>_onDisable()</code>. Again, this is VERY rare.</li>
 * 		
 * 	<li> Please use the same naming convention as the rest of the plugins, like MySpecialPropertyNamePlugin.</li>
 * 
 * 	<li> If you are handling more than one property in your plugin (like RoundPropsPlugin or ShortRotationPlugin),
 * 		 make sure you override the <code>_kill()</code> method which will be passed a <code>vars</code> parameter
 * 		with properties that need to be killed (typically for overwriting).</li>
 * 		
 * </ol>
