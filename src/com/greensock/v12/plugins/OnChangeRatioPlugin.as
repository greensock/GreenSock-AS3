/**
 * [AS3/AS2 only] This plugin allows you to define a callback method that should be called whenever the tween's "ratio" property
 * changes which effectively means that the tweening values changed. This is typically only useful in conjunction with
 * <code>SteppedEase</code>. Also note that the callback should accept one parameter which will refer to the tween itself.
 * This is different than most other callback types, like onComplete and onUpdate which don't pass parameters by default
 * unless you use their onCompleteParams and onUpdateParams counterparts. The reason onChangeRatio works this unique way
 * is to minimize file size (adding an onChangeRatioParams would require either another plugin or adding kb to the 
 * main TweenLite class or changing the syntax altogether to onChangeRatio:{func:myFunction, params:[1,2]} which is
 * even more inconsistent) and because it is such a niche plugin (typically only used with SteppedEase which is quite
 * niche itself). It can be very useful to reuse a single callback method but it must be able to figure out which tween
 * changed its ratio and access its target which is why onChangeRatio passes the tween as the parameter. 
 *
