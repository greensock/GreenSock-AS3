/**
 * [AS3/AS2 only] Tweens a MovieClip backward to a particular frame number, wrapping it if/when it reaches the beginning
 * of the timeline. For example, if your MovieClip has 20 frames total and it is currently at frame 10
 * and you want tween to frame 15, a normal frame tween would go forward from 10 to 15, but a frameBackward
 * would go from 10 to 1 (the beginning) and wrap to the end and continue tweening from 20 to 15.
 * 
 * <p><b>USAGE:</b></p>
 * <listing version="3.0">
import com.greensock.TweenLite;
import com.greensock.v12.plugins.~~;
TweenPlugin.activate([FrameBackwardPlugin]); //activation is permanent in the SWF, so this line only needs to be run once.

TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {frameBackward:15}); 
</listing>
 * 
 * <p>Note: When tweening the frames of a MovieClip, any audio that is embedded on the MovieClip's timeline (as "stream") will not be played. 
 * Doing so would be impossible because the tween might speed up or slow down the MovieClip to any degree.</p>
