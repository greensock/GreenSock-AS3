/**
 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values, but RoughEase provides
 * an easy way to get a rough, jagged effect instead, or you can also get an evenly-spaced back-and-forth movement 
 * if you prefer. Configure the RoughEase by passing an object to the constructor or config() method with any
 * of the following properties (all are optional):
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>template</strong> : Ease - an ease that should be used as a template, like a general guide.  
 * 				The RoughEase will plot points that wander from that template. You can use this to influence 
 * 				the general shape of the RoughEase. (Default: <code>Linear.easeNone</code>)</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>strength</strong> : Number - controls how far from the template ease the points are allowed to wander 
 * 				(a small number like 0.1 keeps it very close to the template ease whereas a larger number like 5 creates 
 * 				much bigger variations). (Default: <code>1</code>)</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>points</strong> : Number - the number of points to be plotted along the ease, making it jerk more or less
 * 				frequently. (Default: <code>20</code>)</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>clamp</strong> : Boolean - setting <code>clamp</code> to <code>true</code> will prevent points from 
 * 				exceeding the end value or dropping below the starting value. For example, if you're tweening the x 
 * 				property from 0 to 100, the RoughEase would force all random points to stay between 0 and 100 if 
 * 				<code>clamp</code> is <code>true</code>, but if it is <code>false</code>, x could potentially jump 
 * 				above 100 or below 0 at some point during the tween (it would always end at 100 though in this example)
 * 				(Default: <code>false</code>).</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>taper</strong> : String (<code>"in" | "out" | "both" | "none"</code>) - to make the strength of the 
 * 				roughness taper towards the end or beginning or both, use <code>"out"</code>, <code>"in"</code>, 
 * 				or <code>"both"</code> respectively. (Default: <code>"none"</code>)</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>randomize</strong> : Boolean - by default, the placement of points will be randomized (creating the roughness)
 * 				but you can set <code>randomize</code> to <code>false</code> to make the points zig-zag evenly across the ease.
 * 				Using this in conjunction with a <code>taper</code> value can create a nice effect. (Default: <code>true</code>)</li>
 * </ul>

		 * @param strength amount of variance from the templateEase (Linear.easeNone by default) that each random point can be placed. A low number like 0.1 will hug very closely to the templateEase whereas a larger number like 2 will allow the values to wander further away from the templateEase.
		 * @param points quantity of random points to plot in the ease. A larger number will cause more (and quicker) flickering.
		 * @param clamp If true, the ease will prevent random points from exceeding the end value or dropping below the starting value. For example, if you're tweening the x property from 0 to 100, the RoughEase would force all random points to stay between 0 and 100 if restrictMaxAndMin is true, but if it is false, a x could potentially jump above 100 or below 0 at some point during the tween (it would always end at 100 though).
		 * @param templateEase an easing equation that should be used as a template or guide. Then random points are plotted at a certain distance away from the templateEase (based on the strength parameter). The default is Linear.easeNone.
		 * @param taper to make the strength of the roughness taper towards the end or beginning or both, use "out", "in", or "both" respectively here (default is "none").
		 * @param randomize to randomize the placement of the points, set randomize to true (otherwise the points will zig-zag evenly across the ease)
		 * @param name a name to associate with the ease so that you can use RoughEase.byName() to look it up later. Of course you should always make sure you use a unique name for each ease (if you leave it blank, a name will automatically be generated).
