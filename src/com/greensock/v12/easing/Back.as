 * Eases with an overshoot either at the beginning (easeIn), the end (easeOut), or both (easeInOut). 
 * <code>Back</code> is a convenience class that congregates the 3 types of Back eases (BackIn, BackOut, 
 * and BackInOut) as static properties so that they can be referenced using the standard synatax, like 
 * <code>Back.easeIn</code>, <code>Back.easeOut</code>, and <code>Back.easeInOut</code>. 
 * 
 * <p>You can configure the amount of overshoot using the <code>config()</code> method, like
 * <code>TweenLite.to(obj, 1, {x:100, ease:Back.easeOut.config(3)});</code></p>
