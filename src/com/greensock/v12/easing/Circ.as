 * Eases with an abrupt change in velocity either at the beginning (easeIn), the end (easeOut), or both (easeInOut). 
 * <code>Circ</code> is a convenience class that congregates the 3 types of Circ eases (CircIn, CircOut, 
 * and CircInOut) as static properties so that they can be referenced using the standard synatax, like 
 * <code>Circ.easeIn</code>, <code>Circ.easeOut</code>, and <code>Circ.easeInOut</code>.
