/**
 * Base class for all GreenSock easing equations. In its simplest form, an Ease
 * is responsible for translating linear time (typically represented as a number
 * between 0 and 1 where 0 is the beginning, 0.5 is halfway complete, and 1 is 
 * the end) into a value that has a different rate of change but still starts
 * at 0 and ends at 1. In the GreenSock platform, eases are used to give 
 * tweens/animations the look and feel that the animator desires. For example, 
 * a ball rolling to a stop would decelerate over time (easeOut) rather than using 
 * a linear velocity. An Elastic ease could be used to make an object appear as 
 * though it is loosely attached somewhere and is snapping into place with loose 
 * (or tight) tension. 
 * 
 * <p>All Ease instances have a <code>getRatio()</code> method that is responsible
 * for the translation of the progress ratio which the tween typically feeds in. 
 * End users almost never need to directly feed any values to or get any values from
 * an Ease instance - the tweens will do that internally.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The base Ease class handles most of the common power-based easeIn/easeOut/eaesInOut 
 * calculations (like Linear, Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, and Strong) internally. 
 * You can define a separate function that uses what was considered the 4 standard 
 * easing parameters by Adobe and many others (time, start, change, duration) and 
 * Ease will serve as a proxy in order to maximize backwards compatibility and usability. 
 * For example, if you have a custom method that you created like this:</p>
 * <listing version="3.0">
function myEase(t:Number, s:Number, c:Number, d:Number):Number {
    return s+(t=t/d)*t*t*t*c;
}
</listing>
 * You could still use that by wrapping Ease around it like this:
 * <listing version="3.0">
import com.greensock.~~;
import com.greensock.v12.easing.~~;
 
TweenLite.to(mc, 5, {x:600, ease:new Ease(myEase)});
</listing>
 * <p>In the above example, the anytime the Ease's <code>getRatio()</code> method is called, it
 * would feed the first parameter as a ratio between 0 and 1 and the rest of the 3 parameters 
 * would always be 0, 1, 1. This is all done transparently by TweenLite/TweenMax, so you 
 * really shouldn't need to worry about this.</p>
