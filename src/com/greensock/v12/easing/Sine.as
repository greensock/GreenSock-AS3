 * Eases with a relatively low power either at the beginning (easeIn), the end (easeOut), or both (easeInOut). 
 * <code>Sine</code> is a convenience class that congregates the 3 types of Sine eases (SineIn, SineOut, 
 * and SineInOut) as static properties so that they can be referenced using the standard synatax, like 
 * <code>Sine.easeIn</code>, <code>Sine.easeOut</code>, and <code>Sine.easeInOut</code>.
