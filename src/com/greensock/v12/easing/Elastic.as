 * Eases with an elastic effect either at the beginning (easeIn), the end (easeOut), or both (easeInOut). 
 * <code>Elastic</code> is a convenience class that congregates the 3 types of Elastic eases (ElasticIn, ElasticOut, 
 * and ElasticInOut) as static properties so that they can be referenced using the standard synatax, like 
 * <code>Elastic.easeIn</code>, <code>Elastic.easeOut</code>, and <code>Elastic.easeInOut</code>. 
 * 
 * <p>You can configure the amplitude and period of the sine wave using the <code>config()</code> method, like
 * <code>TweenLite.to(obj, 1, {x:100, ease:Elastic.easeOut.config(0.5, 2)});</code></p>
