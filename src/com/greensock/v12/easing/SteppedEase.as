/**
 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values, but SteppedEase provides
 * an easy way to define a specific number of steps that the transition should take. For example, if mc.x is 0 and you 
 * want to tween it to 100 with 5 steps (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100) over the course of 2 seconds, you'd do:
 * 
 * <listing version="3.0">
TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:100, ease:SteppedEase.config(5)});

//or create an instance directly
var steppedEase = new SteppedEase(5);
TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {y:300, ease:steppedEase});
</listing>
 * 
 * <p>Note: SteppedEase is optimized for use with the GreenSock tweenining platform, so it isn't intended to be used with other engines. 
 * Specifically, its easing equation always returns values between 0 and 1.</p>
