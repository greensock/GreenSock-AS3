/**
 * SlowMo is a configurable ease that produces a slow-motion effect that decelerates initially, then moves 
 * linearly for a certain portion of the ease (which you can choose) and then accelerates again at the end;
 * it's great for effects like zooming text onto the screen, smoothly moving it long enough for people to 
 * read it, and then zooming it off the screen. Without SlowMo, animators would often try to get the same 
 * effect by sequencing 3 tweens, one with an easeOut, then another with a Linear.easeNone, and finally 
 * an easeIn but the problem was that the eases didn't smoothly transition into one another, so you'd see 
 * sudden shifts in velocity at the joints. SlowMo solves this problem and gives you complete control over 
 * how strong the eases are on each end and what portion of the movement in the middle is linear.
 * 
 * <p>The first parameter, <code>linearRatio</code>, determines the proportion of the ease during which 
 * the rate of change will be linear (steady pace). This should be a number between 0 and 1. For example, 
 * 0.5 would be half, so the first 25% of the ease would be easing out (decelerating), then 50% would be 
 * linear, then the final 25% would be easing in (accelerating). If you choose 0.8, that would mean 80% 
 * of the ease would be linear, leaving 10% on each end to ease. The default is 0.7.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The second parameter, <code>power</code>, determines the strength of the ease at each end. 
 * If you define a value greater than 1, it will actually reverse the linear portion in the middle 
 * which can create interesting effects. The default is 0.7.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The third parameter, <code>yoyoMode</code>, provides an easy way to create companion tweens that
 * sync with normal SlowMo tweens. For example, let's say you have a SlowMo tween that is zooming some
 * text onto the screen and moving it linearly for a while and then zooming off, but you want to 
 * tween that alpha of the text at the beginning and end of the positional tween. Normally, you'd need
 * to create 2 separate alpha tweens, 1 for the fade-in at the beginning and 1 for the fade-out at the
 * end and you'd need to calculate their durations manually to ensure that they finish fading in
 * by the time the linear motion begins and then they start fading out at the end right when the linear
 * motion completes. But to make this whole process much easier, all you'd need to do is create a separate
 * tween for the alpha and use the same duration but a SlowMo ease that has its <code>yoyoMode</code>
 * parameter set to <code>true</code>.</p>
 * 
 * @example Example AS3 example:<listing version="3.0">
import com.greensock.~~;
import com.greensock.v12.easing.~~;

//use the default SlowMo ease (linearRatio of 0.7 and power of 0.7)
TweenLite.to(myText, 5, {x:600, ease:SlowMo.ease});

//use a new SlowMo ease with 50% of the tween being linear (2.5 seconds) and a power of 0.8
TweenLite.to(myText, 5, {x:600, ease:new SlowMo(0.5, 0.8)});
 
//this gives the exact same effect as the line above, but uses a different syntax
TweenLite.to(myText, 5, {x:600, ease:SlowMo.ease.config(0.5, 0.8)});
 
//now let's create an alpha tween that syncs with the above positional tween, fading it in at the beginning and out at the end
myText.alpha = 0;
TweenLite.to(myText, 5, {alpha:1, ease:SlowMo.ease.config(0.5, 0.8, true)});
