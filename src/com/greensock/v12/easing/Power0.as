/**
 * Provides an <code>easeIn</code>, <code>easeOut</code>, and <code>easeInOut</code> with a power (or strength) 
 * of 0 which is identical to <code>Linear</code> but with a more intuitive name. The more power, the more 
 * exaggerated the easing effect. So Power0 actually has no power at all, providing a linear transition.  
 * 
 * <p>This is one of the eases that is natively accelerated in TweenLite and TweenMax. All of the 
 * "Power" eases and their counterparts (Linear (0), Quad (1), Cubic (2), Quart (3), Quint (4), and Strong (4)) are 
 * accelerated.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p>
 * <p><code>
 * TweenLite.to(obj, 1, {x:100, ease:Power0.easeOut});
 * </code></p>
