 * Linear ease with no acceleration or deceleration. Linear is identical to <code>Power0</code>.

 * <p>This is one of the eases that is natively accelerated in TweenLite and TweenMax. All of the 
 * "Power" eases and their counterparts (Linear (0), Quad (1), Cubic (2), Quart (3), Quint (4), and Strong (4)) are 
 * accelerated.</p>

 * TweenLite.to(obj, 1, {x:100, ease:Linear.easeNone});
